  <h2>What is it?</h2>
   The “CleanVisionSpectales” is a pair of glasses that is engineered to visualize bacteria wherever it may appear. A desk is disproportionally riddled with potentially life-threatening diseases? -With the CleanVisionSpectales you’ll be able to spot and prevent a possible infection. “What about bacteria and viruses that are airborne?” Don’t worry, our glasses are perfectly suited to detect aerial bacteria and viruses as well. Say a sick person would cough, the glasses will illuminate the bacteria infested area with color. The color will differ depending on the severity of the bakteria. A common cold will have a cooler blue shade, whilst a more serious disease will have an alarming red shade.
